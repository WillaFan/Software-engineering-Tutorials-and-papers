### Automation Tools ([TeamCity](https://teamcity.com/gotime/) for projects build, tracing) and

### Software Development Process: [Spring](https://spring.io/projects) whose dependency from [Maven Central Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) (other build tool such as, ant, gradle) use version control tools such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs), Docker (container), and Kubernetes

### Software architectures  [High Performance Links: [mpi](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/mpi/), [pthread](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/threads.html), [openmp](https://www.openmp.org/specifications/), [cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone)] [Launch a Linux Virtual Machine in Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/launch-windows-vm/) (AWS) Similar Cloud Services, [Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview) (There is Public/Private/Hybrid cloud type)
